**Description**
The Rule Engine Project is a web application that allows users to define and evaluate logical rules based on user inputs. Users can input a set of conditions (rules) and a value, and the system evaluates whether the provided input satisfies the conditions. The application is built using React for the frontend, and a custom backend (you can integrate any backend or use simple JSON storage) can be used to handle logic and data processing.

**Features**
Add Rules: Users can define logical rules based on different operators like greater than, less than, and equals to.
Input Validation: Ensures that all rules are properly defined before being evaluated.
Rule Evaluation: The app evaluates the input against the defined rules and returns whether the input satisfies the conditions.

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager): Comes bundled with Node.js.


**Installation**
To install and set up the Rule Engine Project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-engine.git
cd rule-engine

**Install Dependencies:** Navigate into the frontend directory and install all required packages by running:

cd rule-engine-frontend
npm install

**Start the Frontend:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server:

npm start
This will run the app locally on http://localhost:3000.

**Key Files**
App.js: Main React component where the application is initialized.
RuleForm.js: A component that handles adding new rules.
RuleList.js: A component that displays all defined rules.
App.css: Contains the main styles for the app.
Usage
**1. Define Rules**
Input conditions with operators like greater than, less than, or equals.
The form validates the rule, ensuring that no empty rules are added.
**2. Evaluate Input**
Once the rules are set, you can input a value and check if it satisfies the defined conditions.
If the conditions are met, the app will display a message indicating success or failure.
Scripts
npm start: Starts the development server.
npm build: Builds the app for production.
npm test: Runs the test suite (if tests are written).
