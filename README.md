**Description**
The Rule Engine Project is a web application that allows users to define and evaluate logical rules based on user inputs. Users can input a set of conditions (rules) and a value, and the system evaluates whether the provided input satisfies the conditions. The application is built using React for the frontend, and a custom backend (you can integrate any backend or use simple JSON storage) can be used to handle logic and data processing.

**Features**
Add Rules: Users can define logical rules based on different operators like greater than, less than, and equals to.
Input Validation: Ensures that all rules are properly defined before being evaluated.
Rule Evaluation: The app evaluates the input against the defined rules and returns whether the input satisfies the conditions.

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager): Comes bundled with Node.js.


**Installation**
To install and set up the Rule Engine Project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-engine.git
cd rule-engine

**Install Dependencies:** Navigate into the frontend directory and install all required packages by running:

cd frontend
npm install

**Start the Frontend:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server:

npm start
This will run the app locally on http://localhost:3000.

**Key Files**
App.js: Main React component where the application is initialized.
RuleForm.js: A component that handles adding new rules.
RuleList.js: A component that displays all defined rules.
App.css: Contains the main styles for the app.
server.js: Main server file for the backend handling API requests.
rules.js: Contains routes for managing rules.
rulesController.js: Implements the business logic for rule creation and evaluation.


**Usage**
1. Define Rules
Input conditions with operators like greater than, less than, or equals.
The form validates the rule, ensuring that no empty rules are added.
2. Evaluate Input
Once the rules are set, you can input a value and check if it satisfies the defined conditions.
If the conditions are met, the app will display a message indicating success or failure.
